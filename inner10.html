									<h1>Designing a mobile app for ticket sales</h1>
									<p>Creating UI UX Design for a mobile app to sell, buy and store ticket</p>
								</header>

								<h3>Background</h3>
								<p>I was given a task to design UI and UX for a ticket selling app that is meant to be a wallet and a marketplace. So in the app, customers can view purchased ticket from the website. At the same time, they also can sell and buy ticket using the app. The app will be a marketplace for resale concert tickets. Those who purchased a ticket but ended up not going can sell through this app. Transaction through the app will be highly secured.</p>
								<p>So the process that I did here was:
								<ul><li>To have a discussion with my boss who was the business owner to understand what outcomes that expect from the app.</li>
								<li>Did a competitor analysis to see how other companies do the business.</li>
								<li>The market situation of reselling in Singapore.</li></ul>
								<p>To kickstart, we did a user research to understand the journey</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Frame 11.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>To kickstart the design process, we started by designing wireframe to determine the UX.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Wireframe.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>After approval, then we started designing the UI.</p>
								<h3>Design system</h3>
                                   <p>Typography and colour</p>
								   <div class="image main"><img src="images/Typography.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								   <p>Component <br>We design the basic components that are going to be used across the app.</p>
								   <div class="image main"><img src="images/Design system.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								   <div class="image main"><img src="images/Design system (1).jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The process of adding components to design system will go together with designing the UI.</p>
									<p>In designing the UI, we also keep in mind that:
									<ul><li>We want the elements to affect customers' emotion and therefore, we apply different label and animation that can trigger scarcity to speed up purchase decision making.</li>
									<li>We want the UI to be modern, fun and intuitive.</li>
									<li>We use human's face as main design for interaction to build deep engagement with customers. (source: https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00909/full)</li></ul></p>
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/Mockup.jpg" alt="" /></div>
									<p>Expected outcomes is people will be able to use the app for ticket sales and digital ticket wallet.</p>
