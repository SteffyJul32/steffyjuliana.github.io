									<h1>Designing a website for ticket sales</h1>
									<p>Creating UI UX Design for online platforms to sell ticket</p>
								</header>

								<h3>Background</h3>
                                I was approached by client to provide UI UX service and consultancy for his startup project which is a ticket selling company. The project is meant to launch in January 2025. It is a website and a mobile app to help customers purchase concert tickets. Take Carousell as a reference for this project but focusing on concert ticket. The unique selling point for this project will be its built-in security through out the entire end to end buying and selling journey.</p>
								<p><br>Website ideation and design</br>
                                   <br>Product Roadmap</br>
                                    To start with the project, I created a product roadmap after rounds of discussion with the client which will be remain confidential. I always use Outcome-Based Roadmaps to identify features that needs to be built in the website.</p>
                                    <div class="image main"><img src="images/ProductRoadmap.jpg" alt="" /></div>
                                <h3>Design thinking</h3>
                                    For design thinking, I am using Double Diamond design thinking which is commonly used to design UX for a digital product.</p>
                                <h3>Discovery</h3>
                                        The discovery method that I used was Competitor Analysis, Market Research and User Interview.</p>
                                        <div class="image main"><img src="images/CompetitorAnalysis.jpg" alt="" /></div>
                                <p>I went through different competitors' websites to understand their business and platforms' UX.
                                    The client had also passed me a market research to help me understand the market situation, target audience and expected goals. The user interview that I did was with my relatives who had used some of the websites to purchase tickets.</p>
                                    <h3>Define</h3>
                                <p>After the discovery phase, I managed to understand the journey and audience who'll use the website. So I created a customer journey and sitemap to help me empathising with how users interact with the platform usually.</p>
                                <p><br>Customer Journey</br></p>
                                <div class="image main"><img src="images/CustomerJourney.jpg" alt="" /></div>
                                <div class="image main"><img src="images/Sitemap.jpg" alt="" /></div>
                                <p><br>User Persona</br></p>
                                <div class="image main"><img src="images/UserPersona.jpg" alt="" /></div>
