									<h1>Designing a form submission journey in website</h1>
									<p>A form submission journey to submit brief to a photograhy and videography agency</p>
								</header>

								<h3>Background</h3>
									A company needs a form submission steps to receive briefs from clients</p>

								<p>This article discuss about my process in creating a form submission journey for customers to submit a brief/request to the company. The company is an agency that provides photography, videography and virtual setup for a listed property. When a property is listed on sales in a property websites, the seller needs to prepare a set of medias to present the house so potential buyers can visualise the listed property before viewing and purchasing.

									Currently the brief submission is done through the website which can be found here: https://www.digitalhomes.io/order-now/online. The client wanted to redesign the form to make it more user friendly for customers to submit a request. The client also shared a reference of form that they would like to see on the new design. https://youtu.be/BKX6EhDrgqQ?si=GYIJoA4cLyhT0sww&t=169</p>
                                   <h3>Design thinking</h3>
								   <h3>Empathize</h3>
                                    <p>I started the process by empathising with the As-Is process and goals. This is the first step to understand the company, business and customers needs and pain points.</p>
									<br>Business Description</br>
										<p>• Business model: a fee for service.
										<br>• Providing visual of an estate in different medias for customers to market their property, such as videography, photography, floor plan, virtual room tour.</br>
										• Helping customers to sell their estates by providing engaging visuals to attract and inform their clients who are interested to buy.</p>
									<br>Business Goals</br>
									<p>	• Getting more orders from interested customers or property companies.
										<br>• Increase awareness of the company.</br>
										• Minimise face to face discussion.
										<br>• Customers share the business to their friends.</br>
										• Increase monthly profits.</p>
									<br>User research</br>
									<p>For user research, to understand customers goal and needs, it is done by interviewing friends who plan to sell their property. And after a series of questions, I summarise the customers needs and goals.</p>
									<br>Customers Goals</br>
										• Sell their property as soon as possible with the desired pricing.
										<br>• Upload photos or videos that can present their property and make them compelling enough for buyers to buy.</br>
										• Move on to the next plan after selling property as soon as possible.</p>
									<br>Customers Painpoints</br>
										<p>• Lack of knowledge and tools to come up with a nice picture and videos.
										<br>• Lack of knowledge and tools to create a virtual room on their own.</br>
										• Lack of time to prepare all the images and videos due to busy schedule since needs a visitation.</p>
									<br>Customers Journey</br>
										<p>To understand how I can value add the submission form, I need to understand the journey that customers face on the website.</p>
										<div class="image main"><img src="images/CJ_2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
									<br>User Persona</br>
										<p>To understand how I can value add the submission form, I need to understand who will visit the website and what are their background.</p>
                                    <div class="image main"><img src="images/up_2.webp" alt="" /></div>
									<h3>Define</h3>
									<p>Next with all the information that I have gathered, I defined the features or information that needs to be in the form.

										Required information</p>
										<p>• Personal information
										<br>• Picture and brief about estate</br>
										• Desired package
										<br>• Any customisation or not</br>
										• Order confirmation to email
										<br>• Payment link through email</br></p>
										<h3>Design</h3>
									<p>Proposed design</p>

                                <div class="image main"><img src="images/Desktop - 2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
