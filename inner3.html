									Previously, I worked in an insurance company in Singapore. The company that I worked with was acquired by another insurance company. It was during Covid period. And because of this, the brand collaterals had to be updated to follow the acquiring company.

So, my next project as part of the UX design team was to update the interface for all digital products that faced customers and advisors, such as website and mobile app.

In this project, beside working as a UX designer, I was also helping to fill a role as a Proxy Product Owner for the Mobile app.</p>
                                   <p><br>Process</br></p>
                                    <p>Through many round of discussions, all stakeholders agreed that in order to save cost and time, we were going to change the interface only. We wouldn’t change the journey, such as, claim processing etc. And to do this interface redesign, it took a lot of time in terms of design and development. And we had a fixed launch date that couldn’t be missed.</p>

									<p>To kickstart the project, as a design team in Singapore, we started by discussing with the design ops team from the headquarter. They would guide us in terms of brand and design guideline and introduce us to related stakeholders that could help us. All guidelines needed to be followed, such as, image replacement, brand colours, logo implementation, font sizing for different labels, etc. </p>
											<p>• An introduction to the design ops team.
										<br>• An introduction to existing brand guideline.</br>
										• An introduction to existing design team (for guidance and review purposes)
									<p>After the onboarding process, the redesign process started.</p>

									<p>Items that needed to be redesigned:
									<p>• Mobile app
									<br>• Main website</br>
									• Internal sales distribution channel</p>
								<p><br>For the design and development of the entire items, we broke them down into different epics. And each epic would be tackled using sprints.</br></p>
							<p>My responsibilities in this project:</p>

							• Redesign UI design for all available screens in the existing mobile app.
							<br>• Review for feedback with assigned overseers from HQ (overseas) design team through emails and discussions.</br>
							• Prototyping for presentation to Product owner and both local and HQ design teams.
							<br>• Working for approval from stakeholders for all end to end UI screens.</br>
							• Working with developers to build the mobile app once approval was given.
							<br>• Checking both developer’s local environment and UAT once screens were finished and deployed.</br>
							• Creating tickets to address issues whenever a bug was found in UAT.
							<br>• Working with Product owner to complete the product design from end to end.</br></p>

                                <p>It took about 7 months for our team to finish the entire rebranding process and now, all the products are launched to the market. They are continuously being improved to support customer service.</p>
