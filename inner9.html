									<h1>Designing a website for ticket sales</h1>
									<p>Creating UI UX Design for online platforms to sell ticket</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01_large.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<h3>Background</h3>
								This is a documentation I made to design a buying journey UX for a startup website. The website is planned to sell resale concert tickets. And I was tasked to design the buying journey. A journey for customers to purchase tickets.
								Before starting to design, I started by doing a research to empathize with both business and customers. Luckily, there are many competitors to learn from that gives references as a foundation.</p>
								<h3>Empathize</h3>
                                   <p>User interviews
								<br>As a first step, I started by interviewing my friends who had purchased from resale ticket platforms. My questions for them were meant to understand:
								   <br>• Their initial intention
								   • Their journey of finding the platforms
								   <br>• The journey in using the platforms
								   • Their satisfaction after using the platforms
								   <br>• Their suggestion on the platforms' improvement if any</p>
								   <p>Competitor analysis
									<br>Comparing different competitor's platforms and journeys.
								   </p>
                                    
                                <h3>Define</h3>
                                    <p>Customer journey
										<br>After interviews, it gave me ideas of what the users went through when they were about to purchase tickets. It also allows me to create a customer journey as a way to map the journey.</p>
										<div class="image main"><img src="images/SS2.png" alt="" /></div>
										<p>Based on the journey, I proceed with blueprint service mapping to figure out the screen journey. This mapping helps me to figure out all features that need to be added on the buying journey.</p>
										<div class="image main"><img src="images/Blueprint.png" alt="" /></div>
										<p>Since there will be more tickets, we are going to work with OCR feature where we are displaying the text from tickets automatically using Amazon Textract. Through ticket analyse, I studied similarity of all tickets to be used as a filter that will help users to</p>
									
                                        <div class="image main"><img src="images/Tix.png" alt="" /></div>
										<p>Filter for ticket will be based on:
											<br>• Ticket type
											<br>• Category
											<br>• Section
											<br>• Price</p>
											<div class="image main"><img src="images/Sitemap2.png" alt="" /></div>
                               
                                    <h3>Design</h3>
                                <p>After a series of learning and research, finally we come up with a design.</p>
                               
                                <div class="image main"><img src="images/Frame 425.jpg" alt="" /></div>
