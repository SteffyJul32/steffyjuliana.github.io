									<h1>About me
									</h1>
				
								</header>
								
								<p>I am a UI UX Design enthusiast consultant. I have worked in design industry for almost 10 years. I have also transitioned from waterfall to agile practitioner. I always adapt myself with changes (trends, tools) but stay focused on the goals.  

									<p>My focus in designing a product is to deliver a design that improves business and help users. The simpler a product, the better it is.  Initially in design, my strength is in the interface design, but slowly, I also picked up UX skill (research, user testing and interview). </p>
								<p>I have worked with different start-ups to design website and app to be launched into market. As a UI UX Design Consultant, I help to make the journey for customers in using the digital platform to be more empathetic, user friendly and intuitive. Many business owners will focus on cultivating business ideas and product's features but less focus on the customer experience. They may miss the fact that customers will struggle to digest and navigate the product. My job is to bridge this gap by implementing design thinking to design the UI UX.
