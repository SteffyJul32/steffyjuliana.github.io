									<h1>Designing a habit tracking app</h1>
									<p>An app that helps to improve lifestyle and wellbeing</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic05_large.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<h3>Background</h3>
								I joined a pitch to create a mobile app to track a habit daily. It was an app that would be launched by a self care organisation. The goal of this app is to help users tracking their dedicated habits such as exercising, eating healthy food or reading a book.</p>
								   <h3>Design thinking</h3>
                                    <p>To approach this pitch, I used double diamond method as my design thinking method.</p>
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/DT.jpg" alt="" /></div>
									<h3>Discovery</h3>
										<p>• Business Requirement
										<br>• User Research</br>
										• Competitor Analysis</p>
									<br>Business Requirement</br>
									<p>First, I started by understanding the business’s goal for this app. Brief that was given on this pitch showed that the goal for this app is :</p>
									<p>	• Helping users to track their habits on a daily basis.
										<br>• Inspiring users with wellness articles and exercise videos.</br>
										• Maintaining users’ nutrition by tracking their daily food diet.
										<br>• Tracking users’ progress on their weight loss and habit’s performance.</br></p>
									<br>User research</br>
									<p>Now, we are going to understand who is the target audience for this app, what is their lifestyle and background, what will be their motivation in using the app. Due to limited timeline for this pitch, I used user persona to understand more about the users.</p>
									<br>Users’ goal with this app will be :</br>
										• Adding new habit for them to track.
										<br>• Tracking their habit and progress regularly.</br>
										• Reminder for them to do the habit daily.</p>
									<br>User Persona</br>
										<p>Creating user persona will make it easier to imagine what kind of users we are designing the app for. It gives a clarity on which function will be great to be added and how it will look like to help the users.</p>
										<div class="image main"><img src="images/UserPersona2.webp" alt="" /></div>
									<br>Competitor Analysis</br>
										<p>Currently they are quite a lot of tracking app in the market. So I used some of the existing design as a reference for interaction pattern.</p>
									<h3>Define</h3>
										<p>• Customer Journey
										<br>• User flow</br></p>
										<br>Customer Journey</br>
										<p>Now, as I am clear about the business goal and user’s needs, it’s time to define the customer journey for this app. Customer journey helps giving me understanding of users’ thought and feeling when they found the app to the point where they are operating the app from end to end. By understanding the journey, it will help to create right navigation and flows for each screen.</p>
								
									<h3>Design</h3>
									<p>With all the research and map in mind, I created the design as a proposal to solve the problem, answer business requirements and fulfil customers’ need.</p>
