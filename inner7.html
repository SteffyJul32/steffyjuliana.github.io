								<h3>Background</h3>
								<p>It was during pandemic time where many new companies were rising up to offer video call services because people were not able to come to office physically. Many companies went from working from office to home hence, more and more video calls were used to communicate between colleagues. This SaaS platform came to offer video calling services with different features, such as whiteboard, notes taking to enhance the experience of online discussion. I joined the pitch to design the homepage website. The design went into the last round. But at the end client chose another candidate's design.
