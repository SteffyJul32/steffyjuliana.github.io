									<h1>Designing an Investment Mobile App</h1>
									<p>Designing an investment app to buy stocks and ETF.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic08_large.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								
								<h3>Background</h3>
								<p>I joined a pitch to create UI/UX design for an Investment Mobile app. For the project, as usual, I used design thinking. Through the design thinking, not only I can create the right interface design, but I also can understand the goal of the business in creating this app and the users to use this app. </p>
								
								<h3>Design Thinking</h3>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/DT_08.webp" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I used the double-diamond design thinking method to work on this project.</p>
								
							</p><h3>Discovery</h3>
								<p>• Business Requirement
								<br>• User Research</br>
								<p>During the discovery stage, I was doing research to find out both business and user goals for this app.</p>
							<br>Business Requirement</br>
							<p>Business requirement was obtained through the client’s brief.</p>
								<p>Business Goal for the app :


							<br>• To share information about companies’ stock prices.</br>
								• To update users with updated information about the market situation.
								<br>• To be easily and frequently used by investors.
								• To have the ability to categorize companies’ search results based on the type of industry.
								<br>• To have the option to follow a company for further information in the future.
								• To notify customers diligently through push notification.
								
								<p>User Research
								<br>• User Reviews
								• Market Research</p>

								<p>User Research
									<br>After understanding the goal of business, we need to understand who is the audience and what are their goals. Since this project was quite limited in the given time, I couldn’t do a user interview to understand the user’s perspective. But what I did to understand the users is through competitor’s app review. I used user reviews to understand what are the users’ goals.</p>
									
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/UR.webp" alt="" /></div>

								<p>Market Research

								<br>I also learned about investment and investors to understand what are the investors looking for whenever they search for information about related stocks and companies they follow. All research is done online. I visited different websites that share stocks and market’s related news. I also studied all the comments sections to understand investors’ thought processes.</p>	
								<p>User’s goal for this app :

									<br>• To update the investors with updated information about the market situation at the exact time.
									<br>• To give the most updated stock price at the exact time.
									<br>• To help investors in making decisions.
									<br>• A reliable partner in investment.
									<br>• Easy to use and navigate.</p>
								</p><h3>Define</h3>
								<p>• Customer Journey
								<br>• Functionality</br>
							<p>Customer Journey
							</br>To really understand what customers will face through the interaction with the app, I also created a customer journey. This will help me to add and propose the right functionalities to the app that will improve the user experience in using the app.</p>
							<div class="image main"><img src="images/CJ_8.webp" alt="" /></div>
							<p>App Features
							<br>• A good information layout.
							<br>• How updated the information is. Investor likes an app with updated and reliable news. Even, minutes matters.
							<br>• The app has an easy to understand chart.
							<br>• The app has an accurate, informative and analytical information.
							<br>• The app has a dark and light mode.
							<br>• An app has a push notification feature.
							<br>• An app with a functionality to set up a watchlist.
							<br>• Great indicator whether to buy or hold.

							<p>So I decided that the proposal of the app will have features :

							<br>• List of companies stock’s price
							<br>• Tabs for other assets’s price
							<br>• Market News
							<br>• Watchlist
							<br>• Search and notification
							<br>• Business Category
							<br>• Company stock’s details
							<br>• Overview of price chart (up to date)
							<br>• Company’s financial details
							<br>• Strong buy, buy, hold indicator
							<br>• Related news about company and company’s stock</p>

							<h3>Design</h3>

							<p>After creating and compiling all the information, it’s time to create the design. Design is created with some reference that was taken from competitor’s app.</p>
