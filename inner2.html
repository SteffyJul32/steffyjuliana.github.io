									The Insurance industry in Singapore is competitive, each of company will release campaigns to grab customers’ attention as part of acquisition strategy. I worked in one of the Insurance company in Singapore, and one of the projects I was involved was releasing a lifestyle and reward app. My responsible was research and design.</p>

                                   <p><br>Discovery: Qualitative Research</br></p>
                                    <p>We went through a discovery phase where we did rounds of workshop with stakeholders to bring out their market insights, goals and expectation for this campaign. We did interviews with the agents who were the front facing line that met customers to figure out what was customers’ expectation.

										Once we had all the information gathered, between the UX design team, we did brainstorming and came up with a low fidelity wireframe. We distributed the design between us and start designing. The first round of mockup, we immediately prototyped it to be tested through user interviews with external people.</p>
                                    <div class="image main"><img src="images/App.webp" alt="" /></div>
                                <p>After Usability Testing, we did receive few feedbacks to improve the UI and UX flow. We implemented before we presented it to the management.

									At the end, the project needed to be postponed to 2026. But it was targeted to be the biggest project we launched after the main customer facing app. It was a fun and insightful journey for me to build this with the team..</p>
